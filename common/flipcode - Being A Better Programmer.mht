I always had this fantasy that game programmers were the cream of the cr=
op. =

Anyone can write a word processor or a Visual Basic application, and any=
one can
hack a save file, but game programmers have to push the limits of the ma=
chine! =

They have to get every aspect of an environment on the screen and someho=
w not
have a frame rate hit.  I always thought game programmers were the cream=
 of the
crop, until I actually joined the industry.  The harsh reality hit me al=
most
instantly and I began to think -even say aloud, <i>I'm amazed our game e=
ven runs. </i><br><br>Traditionally, game programmers worked in their ba=
sement or garage, piecing
together assembly to put pixels on the screen.  Back when the programmer=
 was the
artist because the resolution was so bad actually paying an artist would=
 be
ludicrous.  However a lot has changed since then, games aren't made by t=
wo
buddies in a garage, they are made by teams of people over many months o=
f
development. <br><br>In this day and age, we are not individuals who wor=
k on the entire project.  We
are a piece of a living breathing company that must work together to ach=
ieve
success.  Now there are Game Developer Conferences ( <a href=3D"http://w=
ww.gdconf.com/">http://www.gdconf.com/</a> ),
Online Tutorials ( <a href=3D"http://www.flipcode.com/">http://www.flipc=
ode.com/</a> , <a href=3D"http://www.gamedev.net/">http://www.gamedev.ne=
t/</a> ),
Articles ( <a href=3D"http://www.gamasutra.com/">http://www.gamasutra.co=
m/</a> ), Message Boards ( <a href=3D"http://www.thedc.com/">http://www.=
thedc.com/</a> ), Magazines ( <a href=3D"http://www.gdmag.com/">http://w=
ww.gdmag.com/</a> ), and Books (
<a href=3D"http://www.satori.org/gamegems/">http://www.satori.org/gamege=
ms/</a> ) that allow us to share new ideas and
techniques.  Yet somehow, with all this teamwork, and all these wonderfu=
l new
resources at our disposal, we still manage to code ourselves into corner=
s.<br><br>If there was an approach to programming that dodged all obstac=
les and bugs while
somehow avoiding backtracking or rewriting code, then I'm sure we'd all =
be using
that technique.  Since there is not a perfect way to program, all we can=
 do is
keep our eyes and ears open, observe the programmers around us and see w=
hat they
are doing right and wrong.  <br><br>Here are a few basic programming tec=
hniques that I've observed first hand which
greatly improved my own programming habits.  The most important thing to=

remember when reading them is that although some of them may sound simpl=
e and
elementary, knowing a technique is worthless unless you practice it.  Ma=
ny
programmers effortlessly shrug off things like error checking and commen=
ting
conventions as a waste of time.  So I'd just like to point out that thes=
e
suggestions are intended to improve the amount of time and effort needed=
 to
complete tasks.   After practicing only a few of these programming techn=
iques, I
have noticed that my own code writes itself much faster and more efficie=
ntly
than it ever did before.</font></td></tr></table>

Okay, let's just assume that you are a super human programmer, and you'r=
e code is never buggy and never breaks. Let me be the first to congratul=
ate you on writing the perfect code. However, what will happen when your=
 perfect code is not given perfect data. Will the code assume a pointer =
is valid? Will it try to use a sound file as a texture map?<br><br>As ba=
sic as it may sound, code should not assume anything. The C language has=
 a brilliant standard function called "assert," which was designed to tr=
ap errors. Every time your code is given outside data, get in the habit =
of making sure that data is what you expected it to be. If it's not, ass=
ert AND print a message that explains exactly what is wrong and why the =
program asserted.<br><br>It is important to give a message, this way any=
one can read it and instantly say to themselves "oops, I see the mistake=
". Ninety percent of the time that's what a bug is, a simple mistake. So=
 instead of letting it cripple your game, and waste everyone's time as p=
eople try to trace a bug backward in an effort to pinpoint it's cause, w=
hy not just tell them the moment something goes wrong. Nine times out of=
 ten it can be painlessly fixed. The other ten percent of the time the t=
eam will be made aware of a major coding issue long before it becomes an=
 unfixable problem that everyone will just have to work around.<br><br>R=
egardless of what language you're working in. The first subroutine you s=
hould ever write should be a simple error printing function. Make it wor=
k like the language's basic print function, so it's simple and painless =
for other programmers to remember and use. Then when the program asserts=
 in a case that is not obvious from the error message, you can place a b=
reak point inside the error printing function and the program will break=
 exactly when the problem occurs. This will save time on locating the fi=
rst occurrence of the problem while making it simple to debug.</font></t=

Don't expect to remember what your code is doing. Projects these days la=
st for months and even years. You will not remember what you programmed =
at the beginning of the project. In fact, it's probably the only real gu=
arantee you'll ever get. The sky is blue (if it's not raining, and not d=
usk, or night time), the grass is green (if it's watered regularly and i=
t's not winter ), and you will always forget the details of a bunch of t=
ext you wrote months ago (always).<br><br>So comment everything as if yo=
u're teaching it to someone who doesn't know it at all --someone like yo=
urself six months from now. Think about a team member telling you there =
is a bug somewhere in your old code, and you have to revisit it and fix =
it. If you can pop open your file and understand what you were doing, wi=
thout having to care about variables or parameters. Finding and fixing t=
he bug will be quick and almost painless.<br><br>The technique is simple=
, when ever you use parentheses, have a comment to read what the line is=
 doing. Just write it as if you were reading the line out loud. If someo=
ne else read it, they'd speak it letter for letter not knowing what the =
variables and crazy calculations were doing. If you read it, you would s=
peak it after your mind converts all those calculation to what they real=
ly mean. For example, if a line of code that should only be executed if =
"(frmp>10)", "(plist[i].bdown & x03)", and "(plist[i].y > pond.y)". Why =
not have a comment that says "if( ten frames have passed AND button 3 is=
 still down AND player not underwater )".<br><br>When you comment this w=
ay, you will benefit twice. First, anyone will be able to read exactly w=
hat the function is supposed to be doing without even knowing how to pro=
gram in that particular language. This makes checking logic much easier.=
 Second, if the logic is sound, it's easy to spot errors because a line =
of code won't do what it says it should be doing. In the previous exampl=
e, if the actual code was running when the player was underwater, it wou=
ld be easy to spot what part of the code the bug was in because the comm=
ent tells us "AND player not underwater." If the line wasn't commented, =
you may look at that if statement a hundred times thinking it was right =
before it hits you, "wait a minute, is that greater than, or less than p=
ond.y?"<br><br>Comments have to be one of the most powerful tools a prog=
rammer has. They are universal because all programming languages have a =
way to write comments. It's a shame that being simple and common also ma=
kes them a prime target to be taken for granted.<br><br>This actually le=
ads into our next point.</font></td></tr></table>

At one time I wrote documentation. I remember writing a few dozen pages =
on various systems and modules. The documentation itself was sound, but =
ultimately counter-productive. No one, including myself, ever used it. M=
any people would forget it even existed, and if they came to me and aske=
d about the system I could explain to them exactly what they needed to k=
now in a fraction of the time it would have taken for them to read the d=
ocumentation. Not to mention, there's a chance someone might read this s=
o-called "documentation" from start to finish and get absolutely no insi=
ght on what they wanted to know. The time it took me to write those page=
s of text was completely wasted. Worse yet, every time we changed one of=
 those various systems or modules, we had to change the document as well=
. So I effectively doubled our work load.<br><br>However, the solution i=
s most definitely NOT to skip documentation altogether. Instead, the sol=
ution is to make your code files the documentation. Before every functio=
n, make a comment block that explains what it does, how to use it, and w=
hat to watch out for. If it's a complex piece of code, explain the appro=
ach your about to take to the reader (maybe even yourself six months fro=
m now) so they will understand what they are about to see before they ju=
mp into the actual code. If things need to be used in a specific order, =
say so. If a function only works in one obscure case tell people right t=
here -as plain as day.<br><br>Now, instead of having to open a separate =
document and search for what you need to know, the documentation will be=
 right there in the code. The things you'd normally have to make an effo=
rt to learn will be exactly where you need them, when you need them, and=
 everyone will be saved the time of looking for them. Other programmers =
will be more likely to use your code correctly if they find that you've =
laid out all of the issues for them to see.<br><br>Also, unlike having a=
 separate document, other programmers will unconsciously proof read your=
 self documenting code. When anyone approaches you because they do not u=
nderstand a piece of code, you can safely conclude that the documenting =
comments in that area are lacking. This is something you probably would =
never have been aware of if they hadn't just unintentionally told you. S=
o while you're clarifying what they need to know, comment that piece of =
code further. Now the next person won't have to ask you.</font></td></tr=

I read an article on <a href=3D"http://www.gamasutra.com/">Gamasutra</a>=
 entitled "Postmortem: Angel Studios' Smuggler's Run" (by Charles Euback=
s) and it introduced me to a concept that was so simple, yet so incredib=
ly effective -maybe even brilliant. In this postmortem, they gave an ent=
ire "What Went Right" point to something they called a "buildmonkey." Th=
e buildmonkey was a tool that automatically compiled the entire game eve=
ry morning at 3:00 am and logged the process. This way, at the start of =
each day, the programmers would have a one hundred percent freshly compi=
led version of their project. If for any reason the project didn't compi=
le, they would have a log with errors to tell what went wrong. It even s=
ent emails to key people to inform them if the built was successful or i=
f it had problems.<br><br>Although I'm not proposing everyone go out and=
 code a buildmonkey, I am pointing out the time saved in writing a tool =
that's purpose is to perform a repetitive, mundane task and prevent/catc=
h human error.<br><br>I've already touched on using error checking devic=
es in your function calls, and how much time is saved when mistakes are =
caught and corrected as they are made. Now I'd like to point out the exa=
ct same advantage in data outside the code base itself. Most games these=
 days rely heavily on scripts, ini files, and other data sources to make=
 the game run as desired. However many times, while in development, a sc=
ript writer will make a mistake, or an exporter will dump a command inco=
rrectly.<br><br>Instead of waiting until this data is actually loaded in=
to the game to see if it will work. Why not have a simple DOS program th=
at could check the syntax of such files on the designer and artist's end=
. This program could flag mistakes before the data is ever loaded into t=
he game and would be a huge time saver.<br><br>Now I'm sure many of you =
probably just thought to yourselves "that would be great, but nobody wou=
ld actually use it." Well, it's simple. The next time someone comes to y=
our desk asking you why the game is crashing, you're first response can =
always be "did you run the syntax monkey?"<br><br>Another great example =
of a monkey would be a function that prints out the latest known script =
commands every time the game is run (on a build flag of course). This wo=
uld also eliminate the need to constantly update documentation, and answ=
er questions like "can you tell me again, what was the syntax for an AIP=
oint?"<br><br>Humans make mistakes, some more than others. However there=
 are these nifty new fangled things call "computers" that are made to do=
 mind numbing, mundane tasks over and over again. It's about time we sta=
rt putting them to good use, and save ourselves some time and effort.</f=

The best metaphor for a game engine that I've ever heard came from one o=
f my coworkers, Jerry, someone who isn't even a programmer. He actually =
posed the question to me, "What is an engine? Why make one? What's the b=
ig deal?" I did my best to explain, and when I was done he paraphrased t=
o say that a game engine is a lot like a car's engine. Without it, the c=
ar could never move, but at the same time, a running engine without the =
chassis (tires, etc.) was just as useless.<br><br>I thought this was a g=
ood example and listened as he continued to clarify. Jerry explained tha=
t when a piece of your car's engine breaks, you can replace it. If a bel=
t breaks, you insert a new one and tweak the tension to optimal performa=
nce. At the same time, however, that engine has a transmission, a block,=
 and rods. They are vital to the engine's functionality, but if you thro=
w a rod, you can't just pop in a new one without disassembling half the =
engine.<br><br>Then he concluded that if you were going to build a game =
engine from the ground up, you'd want to build it with a lot of belts an=
d no rods, so you could constantly swap parts out and tune performance w=
ithout bringing the entire engine to a screeching halt.<br><br>Brilliant=
. Not knowing a thing about programming, he hit the nail right on the he=
ad. One of the biggest things that separates good programmers from great=
 programmers is writing code that will fit in the engine like a belt, ra=
ther than a rod. The concept of writing flexible, reusable, and replacea=
ble code can actually be quite simple.<br><br>The key to writing general=
 case code is to not let you're sub-routines become more than a screen l=
ong. The way to do this is NOT to write as much compact, cryptic crap as=
 you can squeeze on one line and NOT to use global variables. The soluti=
on is to break down everything you can into tight, reusable functions th=
at either perform one task, or call the necessary function to complete o=
ne task.<br><br>For example: VectorAdd() would contain a small piece of =
code to add two vectors together, while SceneDisplay() would contain cal=
ls to PrepRender(), Render3dObjects(), RenderHud(), RenderDebugText(), a=
nd SwapBuffers(). However both functions would only be a few lines long.=
<br><br>As you break the code into smaller pieces, you will start spotti=
ng functions that can be reused in other places without making much effo=
rt at all. In the previous example, RenderHud() and RenderDebugText() wi=
ll probably share some core function calls since they both draw objects =
on top of everything else on the screen.<br><br>Many believe that there =
must be some grand design before you can make general case code. When wr=
iting modules and systems, design is an important step, but that is not =
the point I'm making. I'm saying, make it a habit to write everything yo=
u program as general and reusable as possible. Then, when you start desi=
gning new systems and modules, you will have much of the functionality a=
lready available, and you need only call those functions in an organized=
 manner, instead of reinventing the wheel a couple hundred more times.</=

As I stated in the beginning of this article, there is no single approac=

nature to them. When a carpenter reaches that point, perhaps they will g=

ch as plumbers, electricians, and so on.<br><br>These carpenters are val=
ued not because they have a lot of tools, but because they know how to u=
se them --and more importantly, when to use them. Give a carpenter a ham=
mer and ask him to hang a door on it's hinges and he will ask you for a =
drill and a screw driver. Give an ordinary man a hammer and he might ass=
ume the door was meant to be hung with nails. Give a child a shiny new h=
ammer and suddenly everything becomes a nail, just begging to be hit.<br=
><br>It's important to learn patience and good judgment when approaching=
 a problem instead of charging at it and unconditionally using our lates=
t technique. Just because you finally read a quaternion tutorial, doesn'=
t mean their useful in all cases. Use your tools and techniques responsi=
bly and if you don't have the correct knowledge to make the call on what=
 would be the best approach, admit it.</font></td></tr></table>

We're all only human, and although it would be nice to know everything, =
we don't. The danger in situations where we have to complete an unfamili=
ar task is not our limited experience or knowledge, it's how we deal wit=
h it. It's very tempting to accept a task you know nothing about and not=
 tell anyone it may be problematic because you don't want to loose value=
 in management's eyes. In cases like this, some people follow the reason=
ing that it would be better not to say anything than to have someone thi=
nk you might not know what you're doing. Sometimes this approach may wor=
k. You might keep your mouth shut, work some extra hours, read a book an=
d a few on-line articles and get the task completed on time.<br><br>More=
 often than not, you keep your mouth shut, you work lots of extra hours,=
 read anything you can find and the task still gets completed a week to =
a month late. You did it, but at what cost?<br><br>If you don't have the=
 correct knowledge for the task at hand, get over yourself and admit it.=
 Don't hide or lie about it. If you express that you are unfamiliar with=
 or simply don't know how to solve a problem, then something can be done=
 about it. A phrase as simple as "I've done <insert related task>, but t=
his is fairly new to me. What direction were you envisioning this code b=
eing written with? Is there something else in the project that is coded =
with the same general approach, something I could reference as an exampl=
e?" You're not saying, "I can't do this. I'm Worthless -just fire me now=
!" You're saying "I may not know this, but I want to. I will do what I c=
an to make this work right the first time." In many cases other programm=
ers will be happy to share some knowledge and experience with you. In a =
way, it's flattering to have someone ask for your advice. Just remember,=
 it's only flattering once or twice so listen to what they have to say t=
o you, and everything will be fine. Sit there with a pad and pen so you =
can write it all down if you have to. As long as you don't come back rep=
eatedly and say "what was that again?" That's where you will push them a=
cross the line between feeling flattered and being annoyed.<br><br>Regar=
dless, don't be afraid to say something. When you do, someone can teach =
you; you will be allocated time to learn the correct techniques; or some=
one else can do it. The important thing is not to let the project suffer=
, and not admitting your own limits is the best way to do just that. No =
one will know you can't handle it if you don't tell them, and it's bette=
r to let them know before hand, than when you're in way over you're head=

Far too often prototype code is written and it ends up becoming game cod=
e. Many times people (management) will walk by and see something on the =
screen and assume it's done when it's not. So that programmer gets push =
onto another task since they are "done," and a hack gets left behind to =
plague the project some day down the line. Don't let this happen to you.=
 Prototype code is fine so long as it stays prototype code. Once you und=
erstand the process, take the time to write code that will work right, i=
nstead of only working "for now."<br><br>Further more, if there is code =
that is causing a problem, don't hack over it. Fix it. If you can add a =
line of code that will hack it into a state that works, why not spend an=
other five minutes to understand why that works. After that you can make=
 it work in all cases. Do it right and you won't have to deal with it ag=
ain. Then there will be one less thing to cause problems in the future.<=

Many of us also get caught in the trap of "figuring things out for ourse=
lves." Some times we will see nice code that we would like to apply to a=
nother aspect of our programs, however we need to understand what exactl=
y it's doing to use it properly. Prime examples of this are online tutor=
ials.<br><br>When I stumbled onto Jeff Molofee's <a href=3D"http://nehe.=
gamedev.net/">OpenGL tutorials</a>, I thought they were heaven sent. Wit=
h his help, I was able to jumpstart my use of OpenGL, since those first =
couple of steps are the toughest. Excited about the API, I set out to wr=
ite "my 3d engine" (as I'm sure many before me have). Before long, I fou=
nd that I was relying on Jeff's code as a crutch rather than for what it=
 was intended to be used as. I'd spend countless hours fiddling with enu=
m values and commands that I really didn't know, then looking back to th=
e tutorials to see how he was doing it. Finally it occurred to me just h=
ow much time I was wasting because I had to guess what things were doing=
, rather than just knowing. Jeff's tutorials were great, but trying to m=
imic what he did shouldn't be our goal. Now I have an OpenGL book, and i=
nstead of guessing at the details of the API, I began to understand them=
, and in turn I've come to appreciate Jeff's code in a whole new light.<=
br><br>Choose your stepping stones wisely, but remember they exist only =
to get you where you're going and will only slow you down if you try to =
pick them up and carry them with you along the way. It also helps to lea=

This is, by far, the hardest thing to do. Many of us can get very protec=

should ever write should be a simple error printing function.<br><br><b>=
Expect To Forget</b><br>
Comment everything as if you're teaching it to someone who doesn't know =
it at all --someone like yourself six months from now.<br><br><b>Documen=
tation</b><br>
Make your program files contain the documentation, put it right there in=
 the code, exactly where you will need it, and you will ultimately save =
everyone time.<br><br><b>Human Error and Monkey Business</b><br>
Humans make mistakes, some more than others. However computers were made=
 to do mind numbing, mundane tasks over and over again. It's about time =
we start putting them to good use, and save ourselves some time and effo=
rt.<br><br><b>An Engine Has Belts And Rods</b><br>
Writing code that will fit in the engine like a belt, rather than a rod =
using concept of flexible, reusable, and replaceable general case code.<=
br><br><b>A Shiny New Hammer</b><br>
Give a child a shiny new hammer and suddenly everything becomes a nail, =
just begging to be hit. It's important to learn patience and good judgme=
